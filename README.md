# Job Satisfaction Analysis (Work in Progress)

This project explores factors that shape **overall job satisfaction** based on survey data from **Biuro Kapitału Ludzkiego (Poland)**.  
The goal is to understand which aspects of work matter most for people's job satisfaction, and how these priorities differ across groups.

Overview

The project analyzes self-reported survey data from employed individuals in Poland.  
Respondents include full-time and part-time employees under any type of contract.  
Excluded groups:
- People whose main job was **agricultural work (own/family farm)**  
- **Self-employed** or **business owners**, due to data irrelevance and missing responses

Project Objectives

1. Identify key predictors of overall job satisfaction  
2. Assess how different satisfaction components (e.g., pay, work-life balance, management) contribute  
3. Explore differences between groups of employees using clustering  
4. Interpret results through explainable ML methods (e.g., SHAP)
